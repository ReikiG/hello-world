# hello-world
My first repository, it isn't what it sounds like. 
Hopeful massage therapist/free-lance web developer/open-source code contributor. My first major story arch will be contributing to an OBS Studio plug-in that hasnt' been updated for 3 years. My goal is to do this by Friday? 
Maybe will find another temporary sollution. Possibly, skype or google hangout.
